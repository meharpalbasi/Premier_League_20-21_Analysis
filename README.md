# Premier_League_20-21_Analysis
I used data from the 2020/2021 season to answer a few questions.

I first looked at the youngest and oldest players in the league at the time. Then I looked at the distribution of ages and nationalities in the premier league using different plots. 

I then looked at Goals and Assists and identified who were the top goalscorers and assisters in the league. 

I devled into advanced statistics and found the least and most efficient goalscorers using xG differentials.

I then adjusted goal involvements for 90 mins and found the most efficient players per 90.
